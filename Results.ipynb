Jane Wang. I used the [UCID Dataset](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220979862_UCID_An_uncompressed_color_image_database) for training the model.\n","The study aims to detect the tempering process on image documents done by forgery makers using median filtering.\n","\n","# Overview\n","This project follows the following steps\n","- Images from the UCID Dataset are used as a negative dataset ($8028$ images) and median filtered images of the same dataset are used as a positive dataset ($5352$ images).\n","- jpeg compressed images of the same dataset are also included in the positive dataset ($8028$ images).\n","- jpeg compressed images of median filtered images are included in the negative dataset ($5352$ images).\n","- Median filtered images of jpeg compressed images are included in the negative dataset ($5352$ images).\n","- A total $16056$ for each class is used to train the model.\n","- The MFR layer is applied to each image as the requirement for the model.\n","- Define and train the model for classification.\n","- Results are computed for the whole UCID Dataset and compared with the [classical approach](https://github.com/nagar-mayank/Forensic-Detection-of-Median-Filtering-in-Digital-Images-Cao_2010.git).\n","- CNN based approach is found to be $99.00\\%$ accurate on the test dataset.\n","\n","# Data Preparing\n","The UCID Dataset is processed in the following manner\n","- Images are converted in grayscale and cropped into the size $64 \\times 64$\n"," and converted into lossless *png* format.\n","- From one image, six images of size $64\\times64$ are extracted along the principal diagonal.\n","- The UCID dataset is considered as negative images (original uncompressed images in PNG format and jpeg compressed image) for the model.\n","- Positive images are created by applying $5\\times5$ median filtering on the same dataset images.\n","- Thus, the dataset consisting of $32112$ images is prepared with 2 classes.\n","- MFR layer is applied on each image, where the image is subtracted from a $5\\times5$ median filtered image of itself.\n","\n","# Model Architecture\n","Since using conventional CNN models with the raw image pixels as inputs\n","didnâ€™t yield good performances, one additional layer, *the filter\n","layer* is added to the conventional model.\n","\n","Through this filter layer, ***the median filtering residual (MFR)*** of an image\n","is obtained. Then the output MFR is fed into the conventional\n","network.\n","\n","The MFR is defined as follows: Applying the $w\\times w$ median\n","filtering window on a image $x(i,j)$ and obtain the output\n","image $y(i,j)$.\n","\n","The MFR is:\n","$$d(i,j)=med_w(x(i,j))-x(i,j)$$\n","\n","# Results\n","For classification between original and median filtered images, the model gives $99.43\\%$ on the training dataset, $99.00\\%$ on the validation dataset and $99.00\\%$ on the test dataset.\n","\n","For classification between jpeg and median filtered jpeg images, the model gives $99.84\\%$ on the training dataset and $99.55\\%$ on the validation dataset and $99.35\\%$ on the test dataset.\n","\n","For classification between jpeg and jpeg compressed images of $5\\times 5$ median filtered images, the model gives $99.40\\%$ on the whole UCID dataset.
